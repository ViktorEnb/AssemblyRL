Representation of assembly line:

Number of possible assembly lines are fairly limited and can be enumerated

Each assembly line (including end of program) will be represented with a one-hot vector

Allowed assembly instructions:
    mov
    cmp 
    cmov
    add
    ...


Representation of program:
    f(a, program) -> Representation

    (Empty program will be represented as (0,...,0))

Value function:
    V(Representation) -> value


Main algorithm:

Agent.get_action() --> mcts.rollout(policy_network) --> rollout -->  game.get_reward()   



FUTURE PROJECT: 

    ML image compression
